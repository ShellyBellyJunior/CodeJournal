I learned that npm init in atom will start the server. Npm install express in atom will add the package that allows us to create the routes. When you type the code for the routes if you put in a variable you need to do "/ Your Route You want to put in /: And your variables". You can print it out by response.send("") or response.send([]) with backticks to put in your variables.
