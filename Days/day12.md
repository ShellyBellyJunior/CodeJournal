#Day12
I learned that when you do an if statement with a image view in swift storyboard when you type something in the text field the image will change to something else you have in your assets and you can go back and forth between the images in your assets after that you would be able to submit what you type. It will help a lot when you need to change your image when you type in a text field to and submitting it like that way. This helped me understand it a whole lot better and it will also help when I am quizzed.
